# My Projects
welcome to my GitHub! here are some of the projects I've worked on while learning JavaScript:

## Project 1: [Pizza Menu](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/JavaScript-Projects/blob/main/Pizza_Project/Pizza.html)
**Description:** A website/App for ordering pizza. It has many different choices for sizes, veggies and meat. The App will add up all the choices and produce a receipt with a price that matches the selected chocies. We also learned "Canvas" recently which gave me the chance to make some digital pizzas to go on my App.

## Project 2: [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/JavaScript-Projects/blob/main/TicTacToe/TicTacToe.html)
**Description:** A basic Tic-Tac-Toe Game using a table and HTML canvas. It has a very basic AI(computer turn/random selection). It uses images to place the 'X' and 'O'. There is also sound when placing a piece, win, or tie. Canvas was used to draw winning lines.

## Project 3: [Basic Calculator](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/JavaScript-Projects/blob/main/Calculator/Calculator.html)
**Description:** A basic visual digital calculator, with 4 functions. Users can add, subtract, multiply or divide on this sleek web version of a calculator. I added a bit to it so it would also display the mathematical operations in the display window.

## Project 4: [Final JavaScript Challenges](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/JavaScript-Projects/blob/main/JS%20final%20challenges/IndexChallenges.html)
**Description:** I was not as far ahead in my courses so I did not take the time to design a website. I still took the time to do all the challenges and listed most of them on the html document.

## Project 5: [To-Do App](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/JavaScript-Projects/blob/main/todo_app/Index.html)
**Description:** This is a simple To-Do list App. The user can add items to the list, and remove them when completed. It uses JSON and the localStorage with the help of EventListener to add and rermove items from the list.
