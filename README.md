# My Projects
welcome to my GitHub! here are some of the projects I've worked on while learning JavaScript:

## Project 1: [Pizza Menu](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/JavaScript-Projects/blob/main/Pizza_Project/Pizza.html)
**Description:** A website/App for ordering pizza. It has many different choices for sizes, veggies and meat. The App will add up all the choices and produce a receipt with a price that matches the selected chocies. We also learned "Canvas" recently which gave me the chance to make some digital pizzas to go on my App.
