# My Projects
welcome to my GitHub! here are some of the projects I've worked on while learning JavaScript:

## Project 1: [Pizza Menu](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/JavaScript-Projects/blob/main/Pizza_Project/Pizza.html)
**Description:** A website/App for ordering pizza. It has many different choices for sizes, veggies and meat. The App will add up all the choices and produce a receipt with a price that matches the selected chocies. We also learned "Canvas" recently which gave me the chance to make some digital pizzas to go on my App.

## Project 2: [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/JavaScript-Projects/blob/main/TicTacToe/TicTacToe.html)
**Description:** A basic Tic-Tac-Toe Game using a table and HTML canvas. It has a very basic AI(computer turn/random selection). It uses images to place the 'X' and 'O'. There is also sound when placing a piece, win, or tie. Canvas was used to draw winning lines.

## Project 3: [Basic Calculator](https://github.com/Dev-OtedGamer/JavaScript-Projects/blob/main/Calculator/Calculator.html)
**Description:** A basic visual digital calculator, with 4 functions. Users can add, subtract, multiply or divide on this sleek web version of a calculator. I added a bit to it so it would also display the mathematical operations in the display window.
